# LAB 4: WORKING WITH GEOMETRIES
Due: 21 April 2020

##  WHAT TO SUBMIT
You will submit a file to your Github repo via Moodle. You will need to create your own `.py` files for the repo. *Be sure they all contain good comment headers!* Your repo should contain:
- `geometry.py` – with the following: 
   - Include the total length of all rivers as a comment in your code as a comment about the output. 
   - Include the answer about what data type conversion is used and why as a comment in your code at the appropriate line.
- `points.py` – Include a block comment in your code that contains the output.
- `vertices.py` – In the comment header, be sure to describe the output of the code. Then explain, in simple terms, what the for loops in the code do: use comments at the appropriate line in the code.
- `multipart.py` – In the comment header, describe the output. Specifically describe the number of coordinates in feature class Part 5 and Part 9. 

There is no README required for this lab. However, a good README with documentation will help you re-use these scripts in the future and demonstrate your technical and documentation skills to potential employers.
